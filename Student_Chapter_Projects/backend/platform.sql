More tech-savvy marketers can use an API like Clarifai to build custom solutions for content moderation as well as search and recommendation engines based on visual similarity.', 'Marketing', 'ML/AI'),
('225', 'Automated Data Visualization For Superior Reporting Images', 'Automated Data Visualization For Superior Reporting Images speak louder than words. AI is a lot faster and more efficient at transforming data into visual insight than any human expert. Analysts usually use tools like Excel or Tableau to manually create visualizations, but automated enterprise analytics solutions such as Qlik can centralize data sources and generate useful dashboards and reports for your marketing teams. Many platforms now use data analytics and advanced machine learning algorithms to vividly clarify market trends, people’s behavioral patterns, and other information that are otherwise hidden from plain view and not readily convertible to practical insight.', 'Marketing', 'ML/AI'),
('226', 'Sorting food,Looking for fresh produce', 'Sorting food One of the most time-consuming processes in any facility that receives fresh produce is sorting. For example, sorting potatoes by size can help manufacturers decide which ones should be made into French fries versus potato chips or hash browns. Sorting out off-color tomatoes will help decrease rejection by the retailer or consumer. And, of course, all foreign matter needs to be sorted out as well. A product develops sensor-based optical sorting solutions with machine learning capabilities. The systems use various technologies, including cameras and near-infrared sensors, to “view food in the same way that consumers do” and sort it based on that perception. The result is fewer hours spent on manual sorting, higher yields and less waste, and better quality.', 'Healthcare', 'ML/AI'),

This could be avoided if there were mechanisms in place to detect discrepancies at an early stage in the supply chain. Mounting concerns regarding food safety have prompted food producers and suppliers to use cloud-based sensors to provide information on location, monitor status and other parameters that help assess, track and trace the product at every stage of the supply chain. This allows them to pinpoint the specific time and place of any inconsistency.', 'Retail', 'Cloud Computing'),
